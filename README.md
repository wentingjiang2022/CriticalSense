# CriticalSense

This repository includes data analysis for the project CriticalSense:

1. Data on high voltage power lines in a region in Italy obtained from:
https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/rete_elettrodotti_app?locale=en

2. The extraction of vegetation and soil moisture indexes (NDVI, NDMI) from Sentinel-2 imagery focusing the same geographic region in Italy

3. Next steps:
- detecting the pre-fire risk probability map using the data source 1 and 2
- detecting the fire risk severity using the vegetation classification algorithm
